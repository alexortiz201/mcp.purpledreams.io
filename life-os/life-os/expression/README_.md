## 🧭 The Three-Tier Meaning Model (Meta-Ontology)

| Theme Layer | Concept | Function | Examples |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **1️⃣ Realms** | **Focus Areas / Life Domains / Goals** | Define *why* you do things — long-arc intentions or areas of mastery. | Wealth 💰, Health ⚽, Love ❤️, Evolution 🔮 |
| **2️⃣ Arcs** | **Narratives / Projects / Learning Journeys** | Define *how* progress unfolds within a Realm. They are thematic or skill-based. | MCP Arc, Front-End Arc, “The Body Reclamation Arc” |
| **3️⃣ Quests** | **Action Units / Commitments / Tasks** | Define *what* you actually do — actionable, measurable steps that build XP. | “Refactor MCP schedule service,” “Run 5k,” “Date night,” “Meditate 10 mins” |

🧩 Relationships Between Them
	•	Realms are persistent containers (they don’t finish; they evolve).
	•	Arcs live within realms — they are stories of transformation that have a beginning and end.
	•	Quests populate arcs with actionable missions — they can be daily, side, or main.
