# 💎 Life-OS Expression — Human Experience Layer

> **Purpose:** Present your living system through readable, interactive, and evolving artifacts.
> **Scope:** Generated notes, dashboards, and UI widgets produced from RNA transformations.

---

## 📘 Overview

`life-os-expression` is the **phenotype** of your Life-OS — the layer you *see and touch*.

It receives structured data from `life-os-rna` and transforms it into:
- Markdown dashboards (for Obsidian / Notion)
- Web widgets (for MCP UI or standalone app)
- AI-readable knowledge graphs

## ⚙️ Responsibilities

| Category | Description | Output Example |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Dashboards** | Weekly rhythm and thematic focus | `/Dashboards/Weekly_Dashboard.md` |
| **Reflections** | Meta-cognitive prompts & journaling | `/Reflections/Weekly_Sync.md` |
| **XP Logs** | Progress tracking and achievements | `/Data/xp_log.json` |
| **Quests** | Actionable tasks mapped to goals | `/Quests/Main_Quests.md` |

## 🧠 Behavior Model

Expression files are **regenerated dynamically** whenever Life-OS compiles.

They are treated as ephemeral “living documents” — version-controlled snapshots of your current state.
For example:
- Completing a “Shadow Quest” updates `XP_Log.md`
- Completing a weekly sync triggers a new “Focus Arc” suggestion

## 🧩 Integration Points

| Integration | Description |
